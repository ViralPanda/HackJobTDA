Program Summary:

Restaurant Brands International Inc. (“RBI”) is looking for high potential talent who are eager to own their careers from day one.  The RBI Global Leadership Development Program (“the LDP”) is a rotational program designed to create the next generation of leaders for RBI and its two iconic brands, Burger King and Tim Hortons.  The LDP is viewed by the RBI executive team as the company’s most critical pipeline for talent, with senior leadership heavily invested in providing LDPs with the tools for them to reach their full potential.

 

Meritocracy is at the forefront of our company’s culture.  We live and breathe a performance-driven environment where hard work and results speak for themselves.  Top performers are rewarded for what they achieve, and with success, you can accelerate your career as quickly as your talent will allow.  The LDP immerses participants in all aspects of RBI’s business and brands, building crucial problem solving and leadership skills through challenging, high-impact assignments.  Along the course of the program, participants gain valuable experience so they are ready to tackle RBI’s key leadership challenges of tomorrow.

 

Program Structure:

The program begins with LDPs from all regions converging for an intense week of onboarding at RBI’s global headquarters in Oakville, Ontario.  Next, participants experience the quick service restaurant business first-hand through several weeks of in-restaurant training at one or more RBI field locations.  After mastering the concepts of restaurant management, participants return to their regional base office for approximately four months of departmental rotations.  Along the way, LDPs receive additional training, mentoring, coaching, and feedback from senior leadership and other members of the RBI community.

Upon successful completion of the program, participants are placed in a full-time role based on business priorities, performance to-date, and participant preference.  After placement LDPs are expected to continue developing toward higher level leadership positions, based on performance and opportunity.
